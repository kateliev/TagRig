# TagLib
A simple and tiny markup document generator library.

## Introduction
**TagLib** can turn any tag based markup language into dynamic python object that could be used for building simple documents. It is not bound to any specific language - you could use it for HTML, SVG, XML or anything that could be parsed later. Where it really shines is helping you create documents that have many repetitive elements - just imagine a huge HTML table containing any data or gallery made of numerous divs. I've created this simple tool to help me build HTML based typeface specimens and proof-sheets. Also I use it as a simple SVG writer for exporting glyph outlines, but you could use it for anything...

## How to use
**TagLib** is currently semi-well documented, but only inside the code, so please take a look there. Also take your time to check the examples included in `/test` folder.
